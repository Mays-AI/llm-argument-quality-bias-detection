    You are acting as a human annotator. You have been given a financial argument that you need to annotate.
    Please review the argument carefully, then evaluate the following argument based on these dimensions:
    Strength: How well the statement contributes to persuasiveness, considering the count and types of supporting premises?
        Score 0: A poor, not supported argument (e.g., the claim is supported by only one premise that is doubtful).
        Score 1: A decent, fairly clear argument. The argument has at least two premises that authorize its standpoint.
        Score 2: A clear and well-defended argument, supported by concrete and powerful premises.
    Specificity: How well the statement is precise and answers directly the question?
        Score 0: The argument is not related to the question (e.g., blaming the market, mentioning competitors).
        Score 1: The statement partially answers the question, but still implies some hedging.
        Score 2: The argument is concrete and directly related to the question.
    Persuasiveness: From the annotator view, to what extent is the argument convincing?
        Score 0: The argument is not easily understandable, the speaker may state some description, incident, value but does not explain why itâ€™s important. It may then persuade only listeners who are already inclined to agree with it.
        Score 1: The argument provides acceptable reasoning, may still contain some defects that decrease its ability of convincing. Hence, it would persuade some listeners.
        Score 2: A clear, well-structured argument that would persuade most listeners. The speaker stated precise and sound premises that remove doubts of the listener.
    Objectivity: Is the argument based on facts rather than feelings or opinions?
        Score 0: A subjective or biased argument based on particular views and opinions.
        Score 1: A logical argument supported by verifiable evidences.

    Claim: {claim}
    Premises: {premises}

    Please annotate the following dimensions of the argument by providing the corresponding scores:
        Strength: [Rate 0, 1, or 2]
        Specificity: [Rate 0, 1, or 2]
        Persuasiveness: [Rate 0, 1, or 2]
        Objectivity: [Rate 0 or 1]

    Do not provide any justifications; only the score.
